**They look better but work the same.**

I made a new pair of winding sticks. My previous pair, my first pair, I made last minute out of some low quality Sitka Spruce. 

They've worked well enough and have helped me true quite a few boards. 

They didn't have inlays (like these new ones) just a thick black line from a permanent marker. But they are perfectly parallel - and that's what matters. 

So why make new ones? Being able to improvise tools is a great but I also think it's important to invest in your tools, even with beauty. 

This new pair are made from some _mystery_ hardwood I found on the pavement a few years ago. It's light brown, but pinkish when cut. It smells sweet and works well. It has quite big pores and no discernable grain pattern. The inlays: the white strip across the back and the center dots, are made from oak. 

The design is more-or-less the same as the pair [Paul Sellers makes in this YouTube video](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EToMNxJ4-vw).

I used a Stanley 078 Fillister Plane to make the rebate for the long inlay. I struggled keeping the rebate square. The angle I settled for was a little obtuse. I had to fettle the inlay to accomodate the wonky shelf of a rebate. But it came together in the end.

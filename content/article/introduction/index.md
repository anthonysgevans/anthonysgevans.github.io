Hi, I'm Anthony. The Good Work Blog is where I document the things I learn about hand
tool woodworking as I learn them. 

Here you'll find posts about what I've read, what I've watched, 
what I've done and what I'm doing in the world of hand tool woodwork.  

Don't forget to add the [RSS feed](https://www.thegoodwork.blog/index.xml) to your reader to know when there's a new post.

Hi, I'm Anthony, a Welsh born Brighton based community taught 
hand tool woodworker.    

The Good Work Blog is where I try to document the things I learn about hand
tool woodworking as I learn them. Here you'll find posts about what I've read, what I've watched, and
what I've done and what I'm doing in the world of hand tool woodwork.

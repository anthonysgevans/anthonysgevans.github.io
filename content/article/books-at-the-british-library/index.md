This British Library holds a hardcopy of every single book published in the
U.K. since 1900. In the collection are classic woodworking titles that are long
out of print as well as contemporary titles. Both of which can be expensive to
buy.

By becoming a member of the British library (which is free) you can apply for a
reading pass (which is also free) to view any book the library has in its
collection from one of two 'Reading Room' sites in the U.K: London, Manchester. 

Books at the British Library are 'reference only' which means they can't be
taken away. And they must be requested in advance.

You can search the British Library Main Catalogue here.

# Welcome, Croeso!

My name's Anthony. I'm a 'community taught' hand tool woodworker. I say 'community taught' becuase no-one is really self-taught we all rely on the knowledge of others. Which can be found everywhere. 

I take woodworking guidance for books, online videos, forums and blog posts as well as from the people I meet. 

The 'Good Work Blog' is my workshop journal. In it you'll find loads of stuff related to woodworking.
